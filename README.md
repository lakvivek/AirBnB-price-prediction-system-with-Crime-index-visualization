The emergence of sharing accommodation via online marketplaces have drastically changed the travel accommodation industry in the recent past. Airbnb,
a pioneer in travel accommodation industry has created a platform for the people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world. 
The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in
conjunction with every booking. It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries, and the cost of lodging is set by the host. This
project revolves around this concept of shared economy and helps the user in predicting optimal price for the listings and safety level of the neighborhood.
